# Let's talk CSS colours

Playing around with the WebSpeech API, CSS custom properties and CSS named colours. Code modified from references linked below. Probably quite buggy still. Submit issue if you find a bug and maybe I'll get around to fixing it, thanks.

## To setup on local

1. `git clone git@github.com:singaporecss/colour-speech.git`
2. `npm install`
3. `gulp`

- Styles go in the styles.scss file, and will be compiled by Gulp
- Scripts go into the js folder, and will be concatenated by Gulp
